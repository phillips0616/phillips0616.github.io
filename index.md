## Introduction

The problem I solved was motion planning for a holonomic cylindrical robot in a 3D environment with obstacles. The obstacles and robot were defined as collision objects using the FCL library, for static collision detection. I used a PRM based technique to solve this problem. Below I provide details on the PRM implementation, analysis of the algorithms performance, and a conclusion containing what I thought was interesting about this technique and ideas for improvements. 

## PRM Implementation

#### Overview

PRM motion planning is generally broken into a learning, query, and smoothing phases. My implementation of each of these phases is discussed below.

#### Learning Phase

The overall goal of the learning phase is to generate random configurations in c-free and connect them together into searchable graph.

##### Generating random configurations

Configurations are made up of a position component (i.e., x, y, and z for 3D) and a rotational component. The position component is relatively simple to randomly generated. I generated a random number from a uniform distribution for each of the x, y, and z component and stored these in a Point object. The rotational component requires a little more thought. I used quaternions to represent my rotational component and used the method described in Kuffner's "Effective Sampling and Distance Metrics for 3D Rigid Body Path Planning" to randomly sample unit quaternions and stored them in a Quaternion object. Below is the snippet of Python code used to do that.

```python
def generate_random_quaternion(self):
    rand = random.uniform(0, 1)

    a = math.sqrt(1 - rand)
    b = math.sqrt(rand)
    c = 2*math.pi*random.uniform(0, 1)
    d = 2*math.pi*random.uniform(0, 1)

    w = math.cos(d) * b
    x = math.sin(c) * a
    y = math.cos(c) * a
    z = math.sin(d) * b

    quaternion = Quaternion(w, x, y, z)
    return quaternion
```
The number of configurations generated is a hyper parameter that can be modified. Allowing more configurations will cover more of c-free and make finding solutions when searching the graph more likely, but will also increase the density of your graph and impact search performance.

In order to ensure the configurations generated were in c-free I used the FCL library to place my robot at that position and check for collisions against all obstacles.

##### Connecting Configurations

Once you have a set of configurations they need to be connected into a graph. To do this we iterate through each configuration and attempt to connect a path between it and its closest neighbors. A potential path between two configurations is interpolated and checked for collisions. We continue this process until we find _k_ collision free paths, where _k_ is a parameter that can be modified. The interesting part of implementing this was in computing and storing distances and interpolating paths.

###### Computing Distances

I computed the distance as a weighted sum between the translational piece and the rotational piece, using the inner product of the two quaternions, as described in Kuffner's paper. Code snippets showing these calculations are below. Using this distance, I calculated the _k_ nearest neighbors naively, computing the current configuration's distance from all other configurations and sorting the result (performance could be improved by using a k-d tree).

```python
#computes traditional euclidian distance in 3D
def translational_distance(self, c1, c2):
    x_diff_sqrd = (c2.point.x - c1.point.x) ** 2
    y_diff_sqrd = (c2.point.y - c1.point.y) ** 2 
    z_diff_sqrd = (c2.point.z - c1.point.z) ** 2 

    trans_distance = math.sqrt(x_diff_sqrd + y_diff_sqrd + z_diff_sqrd)

    return trans_distance

#computes inner product of the two quaternions
def rotational_distance(self, c1, c2):

    scale = c1.quaternion.w * c2.quaternion.w
    x = c1.quaternion.x * c2.quaternion.x
    y = c1.quaternion.y * c2.quaternion.y
    z = c1.quaternion.z * c2.quaternion.z

    rot_distance = 1 - abs(scale + x + y + z) 

    return rot_distance

#computes the difference between two configurations by weighting and summing the 
#translational and rotational components
def distance(self, c1, c2):
    trans_distance = self.translational_distance(c1, c2)
    rot_distance = self.rotational_distance(c1, c2)

    #these weights are used to adjust the significance of each type of movement
    weight_rot = 0.25
    weight_trans = 1.0
    weighted_dist = (weight_trans * trans_distance) + (weight_rot * rot_distance)
    return weighted_dist
```
###### Interpolation
The translational interpolation was done by creating a difference vector between the current and final positions and then incrementing the individual components of that vector by a small step size. Simultaneously, rotational interpolation is performed using SLERP, as described by Kuffner, using the same step size. At each step the new position and orientation are checked for collisions using FCL. The step size controls the number of collision detections that will be performed, and therefore, has a substantial impact on performance. However, the step size must be large enough to consistently detect collisions between the robot and obstacles. Below are the methods implemented to perform interpolation.

```python
def slerp(self, start_quat, weight, final_quat):
    w1 = start_quat.w
    x1 = start_quat.x
    y1 = start_quat.y
    z1 = start_quat.z

    w2 = final_quat.w
    x2 = start_quat.x
    y2 = start_quat.y
    z2 = start_quat.z

    inner_prod = (w1 * w2) + (x1 * x2) + (y1 * y2) + (z1 * z2)
    if inner_prod < 0:
        w2 = -w2
        x2 = -x2
        y2 = -y2
        z2 = -z2
        inner_prod = abs(inner_prod)
    
    e = 0.5 #value to determine if we need slerp
    if abs(1-inner_prod) < e:
        r = 1 - weight
        s = weight
    else:
        alpha = math.acos(inner_prod)
        gamma = 1 / math.sin(alpha)
        r = math.sin((1-weight)*alpha)*gamma
        s = math.sin(weight*alpha)*gamma
    
    w = r*w1 + s*w2
    x = r*x1 + s*x2
    y = r*y1 + s*y2
    z = r*z1 + s*z1

    mag = math.sqrt(w**2 + x**2 + y**2 + z**2)

    return Quaternion(w / mag, x / mag, y / mag, z / mag)

def is_iterpolated_collision(self, start_point3d, start_quaternion, final_point3d, final_quaternion):

    diff_vector = [final_point3d.x - start_point3d.x, final_point3d.y - start_point3d.y, final_point3d.z - start_point3d.z]
    next_rotation = start_quaternion

    for r in range(self.iter):
        
        next_position = [start_point3d.x + (r / self.iter)*diff_vector[0], start_point3d.y + (r / self.iter)*(diff_vector[1]), start_point3d.z + (r / self.iter)*diff_vector[2]]
        next_rotation = self.slerp(next_rotation, r / self.iter ,final_quaternion)
        
        self.agent.setTranslation(np.array(next_position))
        self.agent.setQuatRotation(np.array([next_rotation.w, next_rotation.x, next_rotation.y, next_rotation.z]))
        for obstacle in self.obstacles:
            request = fcl.CollisionRequest()
            result = fcl.CollisionResult()
            ret = fcl.collide(self.agent, obstacle['obj'], request, result)
            if ret > 0.0:
                return True
    return False
```
#### Query Phase

Once the learning phase is complete and the roadmap has been constructed it can now queried to find paths between initial and goal configurations. Given an initial and goal configuration, the algorithm attempts to add them to the existing network through a method that is similar to how edges are added between configurations. 

The closest _k_ neighbors are found for both configurations and a path between each of those _k_ neighbors is attempted until either a collision free path is discovered or all _k_ neighbors have been tried. A difference between this method and the method above is that only _k_ attempts are made to connect the configurations to the graph. Once _k_ attempts have been made, if no connections have been found, we return failure. 

#### Smoothing Phase

If a valid path between two configurations is found, smoothing that path could be useful. Smoothing can cut down on the intermediate positions the robot will take between the two configurations, and cut down on the overall distance travelled. 

I implemented a greedy smoothing strategy. It works by trying to connect the initial node directly to the goal node with a collision free path. If that connection fails it moves up a node until either it finds a connection that isn't immediately prior to the goal node and can connects to it, or doesn't find any new connections. If it finds a new connection it restarts the process using the initial node it found in the previous sweep. If no new connections were found it moves the goal node to the node prior to it and restarts the process.

Once that smoothing process has completed I search the graph again, any improvements would be reflected in the new search, otherwise I would receive the same path. Below is pseudocode that reflects the process described above. I didn't include snippets directly from my project code because the process is clouded by object naming conventions and method parameters.

```python
def smooth_path(path):
    smoothing = True
    init_node = path[0]
    goal_node = path[-1]
    goal_index = len(path)
    while smoothing:
        found_improvement = False
        
        for node in path:
            if no_collision(node, goal):
                add_edge(node, goal)
                goal_node = node
                found_improvement = True
                break
        
        if not found_improvement:
            goal_index -= 1
            goal_node = path[goal_index]
        
        if init_node == goal_node:
            smoothing = False

    smooth_path, dist = graph.search(path[0], path[-1])
    return smooth_path, dist
```
